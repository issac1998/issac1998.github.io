This thought comes from my colleague. When we decided to handle multiple tasks to collect some values and record the sum of all tasks at regular intervals, we discussed about it but didnâ€™t write the code at that time because our leader thought it would be too much effort to handle a distributed lock. So, I wrote the code on my own computer during my off time.
