GMP是GO的核心，之前看了很多笔记，也简单看过几次代码，但过段时间就忘了。这次自己写一份笔记，希望能增强记忆。

这篇文章先记录GMP的整体结构，以及G的具体实现。

G是用户协程，保存运行函数指针、栈、上下文。M是内核线程，具体执行任务。P则是逻辑处理器，负责管控资源（？），即使没有P，M也能通过加锁获取G（早期Go也是这么做的）或是直接运行在M（sysmon协程），P的目的只是为了管控资源。


G分为四类
1.执行Main函数的协程（）
2.用户协程
3.G0，每个M都有一个G0，主要用于执行调度逻辑的代码，不能抢占、不会被调度、放在系统栈上（？）
4.sysmon协程，不需要P。Ticker等（待补充）

一些重要字段如下：

G会维护一个Stack，记录真实栈的地址。stackguard0记录是否要进行抢占，stackguard1记录是否要进行栈增长

G0和Gsignal(什么用？)

m记录G绑定的m
sched记录gobuf，详细定义如后文
param记录指针参数，四种使用方式如comment所示
goid        goroutine唯一id

preempt标识是否允许被抢占

asyncSafePoint 异步安全点？在哪会用到啊



G的状态:
	// Beyond indicating the general state of a G, the G status
	// acts like a lock on the goroutine's stack (and hence its
	// ability to execute user code).
  不是很理解上面这段话

  	// _Gscanrunning is different: it is used to briefly block
	// state transitions while GC signals the G to scan its own
	// stack. This is otherwise like _Grunning.
	//


G的创建(用户协程)流程  
传入待执行函数fn
 newproc 获取当前g和pc
 systemstack切换至G0栈，执行newproc1

```
 // If systemstack is called from the per-OS-thread (g0) stack, or
// if systemstack is called from the signal handling (gsignal) stack,
// systemstack calls fn directly and returns.
// Otherwise, systemstack is being called from the limited stack
// of an ordinary goroutine
```


必须在系统栈（g0栈）上运行，以避免在分配过程中发生栈增长造成死锁。

这句话怎么理解？

newproc1 
获取当前G的M和P防止被preempt
 1.尝试从当前G对应的P或全局gFree列表中找g（复用gfree列表中已经分配但不再使用的G，查看大小是否合适，若不合适，调用stackfree释放旧栈 （还需要看看gfree列表怎么管理，gfget，gfput分别干了什么））
 
 2.若找不到，创建新g:malg分配栈空间（这里只分配内存空间，例如设置stackguard，stack.hi,stakc.lo，空间分配：小栈从当前P或全局cache中分配，如果栈比较大，会在全局大cache或heap上新建），设置状态为gdead（目的是不让GC scan），将g放入全局G列表。
